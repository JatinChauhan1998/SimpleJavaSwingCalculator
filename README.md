# SimpleJavaSwingCalculator
Simple Basic Calculator based on Java Swing

Swing is a GUI widget toolkit for Java. It is part of Oracle's Java Foundation Classes (JFC) â€“ an API for providing a graphical user interface (GUI) for Java programs.

Swing was developed to provide a more sophisticated set of GUI components than the earlier Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT). Swing provides a native look and feel that emulates the look and feel of several platforms, and also supports a pluggable look and feel that allows applications to have a look and feel unrelated to the underlying platform. It has more powerful and flexible components than AWT. In addition to familiar components such as buttons, check boxes and labels, Swing provides several advanced components such as tabbed panel, scroll panes, trees, tables, and lists.

Unlike AWT components, Swing components are not implemented by platform-specific code. Instead, they are written entirely in Java and therefore are platform-independent. The term "lightweight" is used to describe such an element.

Though Swing is intended to be replaced by JavaFX, it will remain part of the Java SE specification for the foreseeable future.

 * This is a Sample Java project
 to build a Simple Calculator based 
 on Java Swing.
 * This calculator is the basic version
 and can only operate using two operands
 * Thus, making it less complicated for the beginners
